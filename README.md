## Introduction

Plasma combines the concepts of artificial life and cellular automata to create a unique experience. Users can interact with cells that evolve over time, demonstrating emergent behavior. This project is built with JavaScript, making it accessible in any modern web browser.

## Features

- **Interactive Evolution**: Watch as cells evolve based on natural selection.
- **Bio-Inspired Design**: The project takes inspiration from biological processes.
- **Experimental Framework**: Ideal for exploring concepts in computational biology.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Utilize genetic algorithms to simulate evolution.
- **Living Code**: Experience code that adapts and changes.

## Getting Started

2. Download the latest version.
3. Extract the files and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## How It Works

Plasma employs cellular automata to simulate life-like behavior. Each cell follows simple rules that dictate its state based on its neighbors. Over time, these interactions lead to complex patterns and behaviors. 

### Cellular Automata

The cells in Plasma represent a grid where each cell can be alive or dead. The state of each cell changes based on a set of rules. For example:

- A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
- A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
- A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).

### Natural Selection

Natural selection plays a crucial role in the evolution of the cells. Cells that adapt to their environment survive and reproduce, while others fade away. This process mimics real-world evolution, showcasing how complexity can arise from simple rules.

## Topics

Plasma touches on various fascinating topics, including:
